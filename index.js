text = 'In high school I was the class treasurer, had a 3.7 GPA, and volunteered over 200 hours of community service, but I had no idea what I wanted from life. After high school I attended South Puget Sound Community College, I knew I wanted to have a math related career as I love math, but I did not know what I specifically wanted to do. This changed when I met my biological dad for the first time in my life. He is a software engineer and he told me about his work and how he researches and discovers new algorithms.

I am at the University of Washingtonâ€™s Allen School now, I am learning how to make my own projects and model mathematical concepts with my computer.';
